Great question! As a fullstack developer perspective, here are features that would make cdev-ios a **complete mobile command center** for building projects from idea to production:

## 🚀 High-Impact Features

### 1. **Project Templates & Scaffolding**
```
"Create a Next.js app with Tailwind, Prisma, and Auth.js"
```
- One-tap project templates (React, Rails, Django, etc.)
- Scaffold entire project structures from natural language

### 2. **Multi-Session Orchestration**
- Run multiple Claude sessions across different workspaces simultaneously
- Split-view: Monitor backend + frontend builds at once
- Quick-switch between active sessions

### 3. **Smart Command Palette**
- Recent commands history with favorites
- Project-aware suggestions (knows your stack)
- Voice-to-prompt input for hands-free coding

### 4. **Git Workflow Automation**
- One-tap: "Create PR with summary"
- Branch management from phone
- Conflict resolution assistance
- Deploy triggers (Vercel, Railway, etc.)

### 5. **Context Snapshots**
- Save/restore conversation context
- "Resume where I left off" across devices
- Share context links with team

### 6. **Build & Test Dashboard**
- Real-time CI/CD status
- Test results visualization
- Error log search and jump-to-fix

### 7. **File Tree Quick Actions**
- Batch file operations

- Snippet library

## 💡 Productivity Boosters

| Feature | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Offline Queue** | Queue prompts while commuting, sync when connected |
| **Scheduled Tasks** | "Run tests at 6am and notify me" |
| **Diff Preview** | See changes before Claude applies them |
| **Rollback** | One-tap undo last N changes |
| **Bookmarks** | Mark important responses for reference |

## 🎯 "Idea to Production" Workflow

```
1. Voice: "Build a SaaS for tracking expenses"
2. Claude scaffolds project structure
3. Review & approve file creations on phone
4. Monitor build progress while away from desk
5. Review PR, approve, deploy - all from mobile
```

Would you like me to implement any of these features?
